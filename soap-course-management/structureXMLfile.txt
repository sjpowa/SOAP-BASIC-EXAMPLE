>>> EXAMPLE <<<

The XML down here has:

1) It has sender information
2) It has receiver information
3) It has a heading
4) It has a message body

<note>
  <to>Tove</to> [receiver information]
  <from>Jani</from> [sender information]
  <heading>Reminder</heading> [heading]
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body> [we have a msg in the body tag]
</note>

the XML above does not DO anything.
XML is just information wrapped in tags.
