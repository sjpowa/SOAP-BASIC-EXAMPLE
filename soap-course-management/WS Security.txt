>>> WS Security <<<

> WS Security is a set of specifications which is used to provide security to our SOAP web service application.

> WS Security is transport independent, if u are using HTTP or MQ it does not really matter.

> WS Security provides specification for:
	- Authentication [passwords]
	- Digital Signature
	- Certificates

> XWSS is one of the most important implementation of WS Security
	XWSS = XML Web Service Security

> We use the XWSS to implement a Security Policy
	and
  we will use XwsSecurityInterceptor[ it intercepts the request when it will come to the service]
  	so to make sure that
  we will use user-id and password, make by us, to access our service.
