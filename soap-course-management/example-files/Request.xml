<!-- How to make an XML unique to my courses??? -->
<!-- We do it defining a namespace -->
<!-- xmlns="default namespace" is what to use
	to give an identifier and avoid similar courses conflicts -->
	
<!-- I want to get in the id only numbers, not string/letters
	to do that we need an .xsd file to define a structure to our .xml file -->
	
<!-- the .xsd file is something which helps us to validate if our request is fine or not -->

<!-- To say to our .xml which .xsd structure it has to take
	we have to define a schema location where we put in the {namespace fo the .xsd file}
		and as {location the name of the .xsd file}
 after we have set the location,
 	we have to put the XML Schema NameSpace -->
